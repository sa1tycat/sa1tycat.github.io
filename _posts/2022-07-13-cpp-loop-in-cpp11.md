# C++11 range-based for loops

## Syntax

[1]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/range-for

To simplify, the basic syntax for range-based loop is `for(range-declaration : range-expression)`, where:

range-declaration : a [declaration](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/declarations) of a named variable, whose type is the type of the element of the sequence represented by *range-expression*, or a reference to that type. Often uses the [auto specifier](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/auto) for automatic type deduction,

range-expression : any [expression](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/expressions) that represents a suitable sequence (either an array or an object for which `begin` and `end` member functions or free functions are defined, see below) or a [braced-init-list](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/list_initialization).

For example, 

[2]: https://www.cprogramming.com/c++11/c++11-ranged-for-loop.html



```c++
vector<int> v = {1, 2};
for(int i : vec) {
    cout << i;
}
```

In this loop, variable i take on the value of each element of v from the beginning to the end.

If you are not sure which type you should use for range-declaration, you can simply use `auto`, like:

```c++
string s = "abc";
for(auto i : s) {
    cout << i;
}
```

Worth noticing that the variable for range-declaration only receive the value of the element of the container, thus you **cannot modify** the elements of the container in the loop, unless you pass the reference like this:

```c++
vector<int> vec;
vec.push_back( 1 );
vec.push_back( 2 );
 
for (int& i : vec ) 
{
    i++; // increments the value in the vector
}
for (int i : vec )
{
    // show that the values are updated
    cout << i << endl;
}
```

In this case, the elements in vec are modified into `{2, 3}` respectively.
